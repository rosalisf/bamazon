# Bamazon

### Instructions

This program allows you to choose a product from a database in the SQL Workbench. This program will act as a really small Amazon library in the command line.

### How to use

1. In the SQl database, for example, the product Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection, currently is at 322 in terms of stock.

2. Type in node bamazonCustomer.js in the command line to activate the Bamazon program and the command line will ask you to choose a product from the database.

3. After you have chosen, the command line will ask you how much of said product you'd like to buy.

7. If you ask for an amount that goes over the stock quantity, you'll get a message letting you know that the library does not have enough for your order.
